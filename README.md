# AWS Expense Reimbursement System

This is a serverless expense reimbursement application demonstrating key AWS cloud concepts including infrastructure as code, Lambda functions, and Cognito authentication.

## Project Structure

- `/infra` - Contains the CloudFormation YAML template that deploys the necessary AWS resources.
- `/lambda` - Contains Lambda function code for submitting and approving expenses (Python).

## Deployment Instructions

1. Deploy the CloudFormation stack from `/infra/cloudformation.yaml` to create AWS resources.
2. Upload Lambda function code (`approve-expense.py`, `submit-expense.py`) to their respective Lambda functions or deploy via CloudFormation.
3. Configure API Gateway (if applicable) and Cognito User Pools for authentication.
4. Test the endpoints.

## Technologies Used

- AWS CloudFormation
- AWS Lambda (Python)
- Amazon Cognito
- Amazon S3
- Python 3.10
